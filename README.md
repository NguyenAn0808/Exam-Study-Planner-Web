## üíª Project Introduction

### a. Overview

This is a comprehensive Study Management System designed specifically for Vietnamese university students to tackle the daily crisis of time management. The app helps students organize their study schedules, track exam deadlines, and manage their academic progress efficiently. It addresses the core problem of students juggling multiple tasks across classes, group projects, part-time work, and personal life by providing a centralized digital solution for academic time management.

### b. Key Features & Function Manual

**Core CRUD Operations:**

- **Create:** Add new study sessions, topics, exams, and study plans

- **Update:** Edit study sessions, mark progress, update exam details
- **Delete:** Remove completed or canceled study sessions and topics

**Three Main Views:**

1. **Dashboard View:** Overview of today's study plan, upcoming exams, and progress statistics
2. **Calendar/Schedule View:** Weekly and monthly view of all study sessions and exam deadlines
3. **Progress/Analytics View:** Charts and analytics showing study patterns and achievement tracking

**Key Features:**

- Study session time tracking and management
- Exam deadline monitoring with collision detection
- Topic-based learning progress tracking
- AI-powered study plan recommendations
